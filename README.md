# bsv_examples
This repo contains examples in Bluespec System Verilog either developed from scratch or generated by AI chatbots (Chat GPT, Gemini, Co-Pilot, etc.).

To play with the examples, use the following steps:

source env64.csh
chex <example_name>        # e.g. "chex chat_gpt_bypass_fifo"

"chex" is an aliased command defined in "env64.csh"
After executing the command, the directory will be automatically changed to the example directory.
There is a "makefile" in each example directory which includes "bsv.mk" from "bsv_examples"
directory. The "bsv.mk" contains all the make commands to build and run examples
with different simulators. 

env64.csh also defines several environment variables and aliases for changing directories.
For example, $bsv points to example directory and "bsv" is an alias for "cd $bsv".
From the example directory, type "make help" to get more information bout makefile targets.

For quick simulation with bluesim:

make bsim
make run_bsim

For quick simulation with verilator:
make synth              (or just make.  The verilog code will be generated in $v_dir)
make link_verilator     (build verilator simulation target)
make run_verilator
